## 📜 About

The **Flutter Web Blog** is a **PROJECT** that was developed to explore both Flutter and Flutter integrated into Firebase (Firestore + Google Sign-in).

As shown in the preview above, Upload, Authentication and Login are already functional resources and were well explored.
In general, after finishing the project, I conclude that it was a great learning experience and a great experience working with this incredible Framework that is Flutter.
